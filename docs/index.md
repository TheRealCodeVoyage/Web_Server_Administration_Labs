# ACIT 3475: Web Server Administration Labs
This repository contains lab exercises for BCIT's ACIT 3475 Web Server Administration 
course. This course introduces students to the deployment and operation of web applications. Students will implement an existing application into a web stack including web servers, databases, and application servers, improving the stack throughout the course. Topics include Web Server Management, Application Servers, Load Balancing, Caching, Performance Measurement, Reverse Proxies, TLS/SSL Security, Authentication Mechanisms, and Centralized Logging.
