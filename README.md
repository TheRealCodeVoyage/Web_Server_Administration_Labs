Welcome to the repository for the **Web Server Administration** course. This course introduces 
the deployment, management, and optimization of web applications using modern web stacks.  

## Course Topics  
- Web Server Management (Apache, Nginx, IIS)  
- Reverse Proxies and Load Balancing  
- Caching, Compression, and Performance Measurement  
- SSL/TLS Configuration and Encryption Offloading  
- Authentication Mechanisms (OAuth, Token-Based Systems)  
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)  
- Centralized Logging and Monitoring  

## Learning Objectives  
By completing this course, students will be able to:  
- Deploy and manage web servers for scalable, distributed applications.  
- Implement software-based load balancing using HAProxy.  
- Configure secure communication using TLS and X.509 certificates.  
- Integrate dynamic web applications with caching and compression.  
- Use reverse proxies and CDNs to optimize web performance.  
- Centralize logging for improved monitoring and diagnostics.
